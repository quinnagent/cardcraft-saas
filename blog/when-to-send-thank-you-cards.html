    <h1>When to Send Wedding Thank You Cards: Complete Timeline & Etiquette Guide</h1>
    
    <p>One of the most common questions after the wedding is: <strong>When do I need to send thank you cards?</strong> The good news is you have more time than you think. Here's everything you need to know about timing, etiquette, and getting those cards out without the stress.</p>
    
    <h2>The Golden Rule: 3 Months</h2>
    
    <div class="timeline">
        <h3>Traditional Timeline</h3>
        <p>Etiquette experts recommend sending wedding thank you cards within <strong>3 months</strong> of your wedding date. This gives you enough time to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enjoy your honeymoon</li>
            <li>Settle into married life</li>
            <li>Gather all your gift information</li>
            <li>Write thoughtful, personalized messages</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Can You Send Them Later?</h2>
    
    <p>Yes! While 3 months is the standard, it's truly never too late to send a thank you card. A late thank you is always better than no thank you at all. If you're past the 3-month mark, simply acknowledge the delay in your message:</p>
    
    <p><em>"We're sorry this is reaching you later than intended, but please know how much we appreciated having you at our wedding..."</em></p>
    
    <h2>Special Situations</h2>
    
    <div class="timeline">
        <h3>Gifts Received Before the Wedding</h3>
        <p>Send these thank you cards <strong>within 2 weeks</strong> of receiving the gift. This shows appreciation and confirms you received it safely.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="timeline">
        <h3>Gifts Received After the Wedding</h3>
        <p>Follow the standard 3-month timeline from your wedding date, regardless of when the gift arrived.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="timeline">
        <h3>Destination Weddings</h3>
        <p>Guests who traveled especially far? Consider sending these thank you cards first, within 4-6 weeks, while the experience is fresh.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Tips for Getting It Done Fast</h2>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Don't wait to start! Set a goal of writing 5-10 cards per day. You'll be done in no time without feeling overwhelmed.
    </div>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Batch your work:</strong> Set aside specific times for writing cards</li>
        <li><strong>Stay organized:</strong> Keep a spreadsheet of gifts and guests</li>
        <li><strong>Use templates:</strong> Have a few message templates ready to customize</li>
        <li><strong>Divide and conquer:</strong> Both partners can write cards</li>
    </ul>
